Areas to Contribute
===================

Drivers
=======

Kwapi aims at supporting various drivers. If you have a non-supported
wattmeter, you can easily contribute by writing a new one.


Plugins
=======

Kwapi plugins process the metrics. You can contribute by writing new plugins to
bring new functionnalities.

Testing
=======

The first version of Kwapi has not yet unit tests and has not seen much
run-time in real environments.

Working with the Source
=======================

Setting up a Development Sandbox
================================

1. Set up a server or virtual machine.

2. Clone the kwapi project to the machine::

    $ git clone https://github.com/lpouillo/kwapi-g5k.git
    $ cd ./kwapi-g5k

3. Once this is done, use develop option of `setup.py` file to install kwapi locally::

    $ python setup.py develop

4. If some dependant packages are missing, fix them with `pip install`::

    $ pip install -r requirments.txt

4. You can start to hack kwapi. If you are preparing a patch, create a topic branch and switch to
   it before making any changes::

    $ git checkout -b TOPIC-BRANCH

5. Use git to push your changes and ask for a pull request.

6. Package your solution for Debian installation::

    $ python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb
    $ cd deb_dist/
    
   All the deb archives are exported in this directory.

7. Import the new generated packages of kwapi-g5k on the remote apt repository.

8. Execute Puppet on the VM to install the latest version of Kwapi or simply run::

    $ apt-get update && apt-get install python-kwapi-g5k
